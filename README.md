# Sozluk

## Aim

- The goal of this project is to improve upon [TDK Dictionary](https://sozluk.gov.tr) (Official Online Turkish Dictionary) by adding new features such as client-side routing and enhancing the user interface.

- It uses TDK Dictionary API to render the definitions of the words.

### Additional Features

- Client-Side Routing

- Dark-Light Mode

- Different Font Options

- Caching

- Better and Simple Design and Animations

## Project State

- There won't be any further improvement in this project. However, I'm planning to create a brand new dictionary website by building both the backend using Node.js and Prisma or maybe .NET and the frontend using Next.js with additional features! I might be able to build the whole dictionary using only Next.js and Prisma though, I've not decided yet.
- You can open issues if you see any bugs though. I'll be trying to fix them if so.
- The new project will be open source as well, so I'd be happy if you help me!
